Florida is under Title IX violations investigation by the US Department of Education<!--more--> for their handling of a sexual abused case against star junior wide receiver Antonio Callaway.

<br />
### Marijuana Possession
In May of this year, Callaway was cited for possession of marijuana after a traffic stop. Head Coach Jim McElwain has expressed his disappointment in Callaway's actions and it is not clear at this point if this will impact his availability this upcoming season. 

<br />
### Leading Receiver
Callaway was the Gator's leading receiver in 2016 with 721 yards on 54 receptions and three touchdowns. No other Gator receiver broke 400 yards receiving. If Callaway is unable to play, this will be a devastating blow to the Gators and their hopes of repeating their SEC East Division championship.

<br />
### Impact on Team
Also unclear is how this investigation might impact the Gator program if the school is found guilty of Title IX violations. Probation or loss of scholarships may be a hard blow for a football team and coaching staff still searching for it's identity.
