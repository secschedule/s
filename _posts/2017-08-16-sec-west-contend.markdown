### Who will challenge Alabama for supremacy in the SEC West?

It is a forgone conclusion by many football pundits that Alabama is once again at the head of the class the SEC Conference and a preseason favorite to not only win the SEC but also to make the playoffs and contend for the national title. Can anyone in the SEC West stand in their way?

It is both easy and hard to make predictions before a down is even played. Based on the direction teams are headed in and changes made in the off-season, it looks like the SEC West could be a three team race between the Tide, Auburn and LSU. Anything can happen, but it appears that the rest of the west may be a few years away or dealing with coaching distractions, including Ole Miss and the Hugh Freeze situation and the uncertainty around Kevin Sumlin. 

There is no need to go over Alabama's pedigree, we all know it. Let's focus on the two potential contenders, Aurburn and LSU. 

## Auburn

At Auburn, this is a make or break season for head coach Gus Malzahn. Auburn's strength is in the fact that they are returning 15 starters from a team that went 8-5 last season. They did not have a great year, but a more mature squad should improve on those numbers. Whether the additional experience is enough to keep pace with Alabama and their superstar in the making QB Jalen Hurts is another story. Auburn is also coming off two strong recruiting classes in 2015 and 2016 and those players should start paying dividends. On the negative for Aurburn, they have some questions at QB with former Baylor QB Jarrett Stidham taking over for 2016 starter Sean White. Only some football games will tell us if that was a good decision. The Tigers also get Alabama Jordan-Hare this year.

## LSU

The other contenders are the LSU Tigers. The Tigers had a better 2016 than their record would indicate. The finished 8-4 last year, but the 4 loses were by an average of less than a touchdown. Also, after Ed Orgeron took over for Les Miles, they went 8-2, with one of those loses against Alabama, and including a big win at he Cirtus Bowl against a very good Louisville team. Orgeron is the type of coach that inspires his players to play their best. After a horrible stint at Ole Miss earlier in his career, he's had success taking over USC and LSU on an interim basis. Now that he has the full reigns, it will be interesting to see what he can do. LSU returns only 11 starters, tied for the fewest in the SEC, and has a big question mark at QB. But with two top 5 recruiting classes in 2015 and 2016 coming into their own, and the players wanting to show that LSU made the write decision in retaining Orgeron, the Tigers could be a dangerous team.

## Alabama

At the end of the day, Alabama is just that much better than anyone else. They have arguable the best QB in the conference, the best coach in the league, and LSU at home. At least for one more year, Alabama should have no problem winning the SEC again and fighting for the national championship.
